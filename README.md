## Overview

Bookmark Manager Zero is a Firefox extension that provides a beautiful, feature-rich sidebar interface for managing your native Firefox bookmarks. It enhances your bookmark management experience with modern UI, advanced search, safety checking, and intelligent organization tools.

### Why Bookmark Manager Zero?

**The only bookmark manager with integrated security scanning.**

Other bookmark tools make you choose between organization OR security. Bookmark Manager Zero combines both:

| Feature | Bookmark Manager Zero | [Bookmarks clean up](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/bookmarks-clean-up/) | [Bookmarks Organizer](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/bookmarks-organizer/) | [Malware & URL Scanner](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pinkddkghldnoglcngpeolboghcbenfh) |
|---------|:--------------------:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|:---------------------:|
| Modern bookmark UI | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Dead link detection | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Parked domain detection | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Multi-source malware scanning | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Safety indicators on bookmarks | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Suspicious pattern detection | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| No tracking/analytics | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Website previews | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

Stop blindly clicking old bookmarks. Know which links are dead, parked, or potentially dangerous before you visit them.

## How Link & Safety Checking Works

This section provides technical details on how the extension determines link status and safety for anyone interested in the methodology.

### Link Status Checking

The extension checks if bookmark URLs are still accessible and categorizes them as **Live**, **Dead**, or **Parked**.

#### Detection Method

1. **Initial Domain Check**: The URL's domain is first checked against a list of known domain parking services (HugeDomains, GoDaddy, Namecheap, Sedo, etc.)

2. **HTTP HEAD Request**: A lightweight HEAD request is sent to the URL with a 10-second timeout
   - No page content is downloaded
   - Only HTTP response codes are checked
   - Credentials are omitted for privacy

3. **Response Code Interpretation**:
   - **2xx or 3xx** → Live (successful response or redirect)
   - **4xx or 5xx** → Dead (client/server error)
   - **Timeout/Network Error** → Dead

4. **Redirect Analysis**: If the URL redirects, the final destination is checked against parking domain lists

5. **Content Analysis** (for ambiguous cases): Page HTML is analyzed for 50+ parking indicators like "domain for sale", "buy this domain", "parked free", etc.

6. **Fallback Strategy**: If HEAD fails due to CORS, a GET request with `no-cors` mode is attempted

#### Caching
Results are cached locally for 7 days to minimize network requests.

---

### Safety Checking

The extension checks URLs against multiple threat databases to identify malicious, phishing, or scam websites.

#### Phase 1: Blocklist Lookup (Free, No API Key Required)

URLs are checked against four community-maintained blocklists:

| Source | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **[URLhaus](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/)** | Malware URLs | Database by abuse.ch tracking malware distribution sites |
| **[BlockList Project - Malware](https://github.com/blocklistproject/Lists)** | Malware Domains | Community-maintained malware domain list |
| **[BlockList Project - Phishing](https://github.com/blocklistproject/Lists)** | Phishing Domains | Known phishing sites |
| **[BlockList Project - Scam](https://github.com/blocklistproject/Lists)** | Scam Domains | Known scam websites |

- Blocklists are downloaded and cached locally
- Updated every 24 hours
- Both full URLs and domains are checked
- **Any match → Unsafe** (shows which source flagged it)

#### Phase 2: Google Safe Browsing (Optional, Requires Free API Key)

If configured, URLs are checked against Google's threat database:

- **Threat Types Checked**: Malware, Social Engineering, Unwanted Software, Potentially Harmful Applications
- **Method**: POST request to Safe Browsing API v4
- **Rate Limit**: 10,000 requests/day (free tier)
- **Any match → Unsafe**

#### Phase 3: VirusTotal (Optional, Requires Free API Key)

If configured, URLs are submitted to VirusTotal's multi-engine scanner:

1. URL is submitted for analysis
2. Results are retrieved after 2 seconds
3. Multiple antivirus engines analyze the URL

**Threat Determination**:
- **2+ engines flag as malicious → Unsafe**
- **1 malicious OR 2+ suspicious → Warning**
- **0 detections → Safe**

**Rate Limit**: 500 requests/day, 4 requests/minute (free tier)

#### Phase 4: Suspicious Pattern Detection

If all above checks pass, the URL is analyzed for suspicious patterns:

| Pattern | Detection | Result |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **HTTP Only** | URL uses `http://` instead of `https://` | Warning |
| **URL Shortener** | Domain is bit.ly, tinyurl.com, t.co, etc. (15+ services) | Warning |
| **Suspicious TLD** | Domain ends in .xyz, .top, .tk, .ml, .ga, .cf, .gq, etc. | Warning |
| **IP Address** | URL uses IP address instead of domain name | Warning |

#### Final Status Determination

| Check Result | Final Status |
|--------------|--------------|
| Blocklist match | **Unsafe** (red shield) |
| Google Safe Browsing match | **Unsafe** (red shield) |
| VirusTotal 2+ malicious | **Unsafe** (red shield) |
| VirusTotal 1 malicious or 2+ suspicious | **Warning** (yellow shield) |
| Suspicious patterns found | **Warning** (yellow shield) |
| All checks pass | **Safe** (green shield) |

#### Caching & Privacy

- All results are cached locally for 7 days
- Only URLs are sent to external services (no personal data)
- API keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage
- All features can be disabled in settings
- In private browsing, cache uses memory only (no disk writes)

- Skip safety checks for trusted sites
- Override false positives
- Whitelist is stored locally and persists across sessions
